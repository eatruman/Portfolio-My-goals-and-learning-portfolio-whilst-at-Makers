 ## Week 1 learning and reflections:
 
### Goal: I can describe basic principles like encapsulation

**Encapsulation** is grouping things together in one area. In Ruby this would be a class. 
You’re taking all of the data that you need that relates to each other and putting it in one group. *Cohesion* is ensuring that the data and methods in the class actually relate to each other. If they are cohesive it will be clear that they all belong in the same class together. You can also include privacy settings in encapsulation so that some of the data stored is public and can always be accessed and some is private. You do this by setting “Public” or “Private” before the method. 

**SRP** stands for *single responsibility principle*. It means that each class should only have one purpose or responsibility. This relates to cohesion because if each class is cohesive it will only have one responsibility.  To keep code clear and easy to understand you don’t want every action jammed into one class. They need to be split up into different categories (encapsulation) that each have a specific responsibility and fully execute that responsibility.
